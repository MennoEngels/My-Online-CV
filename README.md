# My-Online-CV
Welcome to my GitHub repository for my online CV! This project serves as a digital version of my professional resume, allowing visitors to view and download the latest version of my CV in PDF format.

The repository contains the necessary code to convert my CV from HTML to PDF using an API, ensuring that the PDF is always up-to-date with the latest changes made to my online CV. 

Feel free to clone this repository and modify the code to create your own online CV, or use it as a reference for your own projects. Thank you for visiting!
